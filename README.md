# Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks

This code implements Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks (SGANs) on top of Lasagne/Theano, as published in the paper
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08207](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08207)

The code was tested on top of Lasagne (version 0.2.dev1) and Theano (0.9.0dev2).

### Very Brief Model Description
SGANs can generate sample textures of arbitrary size that look strikingly similar - but not exactly the same - compared to a single (or several) source image(s).
- SGANs can be thought of as a convolutional roll-out of [Radford et al.'s](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code) deep convolutional generative adversarial networks for texture synthesis
- the fully convolutional nature allows for real-time generation of high resolution images
- the method can fuse multiple source images and is highly scalable w.r.t. to output texture size and allows for generation of tiled textures


### Examples
You can generate samples from a stored model. E.g. you can use the checked-in model:
```
python demo_generation.py models/barcac_filters64_npx257_5gL_5dL_epoch50.sgan
```
This model was trained on a google maps image of barcelona, and yields a texture image like e.g. this

### Training the Model
To train the model on new images, edit the config.py file and set the texture_dir variable to a folder containing the image(s) you want to learn from. You might also want to change other parameters of the network there (e.g. depth, number of filters per layer etc...). Then run
```
python sgan.py
```
to train the model. Snapshots of the model will be stored in the subfolder models/ and samples after each epoch will be stored in samples/
